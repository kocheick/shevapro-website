# Getting Started with Kotlin Multiplatform

Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) has revolutionized the way we think about cross-platform development. Instead of maintaining
separate codebases for different platforms, KMP allows you to share business logic while keeping platform-specific UI
code native.

## Why Choose Kotlin Multiplatform?

### Benefits

- **Code Reuse**: Share business logic, networking, and data models across platforms
- **Native Performance**: Platform-specific implementations ensure optimal performance
- **Gradual Adoption**: Integrate KMP into existing projects incrementally
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Kotlin's strong type system across all platforms

### Supported Platforms

- Android
- iOS
- JVM (Desktop, Server)
- JavaScript (Web)
- Native (Linux, Windows, macOS)

## Setting Up Your First KMP Project

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio
- Kotlin plugin (latest version)
- Android SDK
- Xcode (for iOS development)

### Project Structure

```
shared/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ commonMain/kotlin/     # Shared code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ androidMain/kotlin/    # Android-specific code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ iosMain/kotlin/        # iOS-specific code
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ commonTest/kotlin/     # Shared tests
â”œâ”€â”€ androidApp/                # Android application
â””â”€â”€ iosApp/                    # iOS application
```

## Creating Shared Business Logic

Here's a simple example of shared code:

```kotlin
// commonMain/kotlin/NetworkClient.kt
class NetworkClient {
    suspend fun fetchUser(id: String): User {
        // Shared networking logic
        return httpClient.get("/users/$id")
    }
}

data class User(
    val id: String,
    val name: String,
    val email: String
)
```

## Platform-Specific Implementations

Sometimes you need platform-specific implementations:

```kotlin
// commonMain/kotlin/PlatformName.kt
expect fun getPlatformName(): String

// androidMain/kotlin/PlatformName.kt
actual fun getPlatformName(): String = "Android"

// iosMain/kotlin/PlatformName.kt
actual fun getPlatformName(): String = "iOS"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin by sharing data models and business logic
2. **Keep UI Native**: Use platform-specific UI frameworks for the best user experience
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Write comprehensive tests for your shared code
4. **Use Dependency Injection**: Libraries like Koin work great with KMP
5. **Leverage Coroutines**: For asynchronous programming across platforms

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Dependency Management

Not all libraries support KMP. Consider these alternatives:

- **Ktor** for networking (instead of Retrofit/OkHttp)
- **SQLDelight** for databases (instead of Room)
- **Kotlinx.datetime** for date/time handling

### iOS Integration

When working with iOS:

- Use `@ObjC` annotations for better Swift interop
- Be mindful of memory management
- Consider using Cocoapods for dependency management

## Conclusion

Kotlin Multiplatform offers an excellent balance between code sharing and platform-specific optimization. While there's
a learning curve, the benefits of reduced development time and consistent business logic make it worth the investment.

Start with a small shared module in your existing project and gradually expand as you become more comfortable with the
ecosystem.
