# Migration Summary: Kotlin/JS React to Kobweb

This document provides an overview of the migration plan and related documents for converting the existing Kotlin/JS React portfolio website (`shevapro-webapp`) to the Kobweb framework (`shevapro-website`).

## Document Overview

The migration documentation consists of the following files:

1. **migration-plan.md**: The original migration plan document
2. **updated-migration-plan.md**: An enhanced migration plan with current progress and detailed mapping
3. **implementation-checklists.md**: Detailed task lists for each implementation team
4. **component-architecture.md**: Guidelines for component structure and patterns
5. **styling-guidelines.md**: Guidelines for styling approach using Silk UI

## Current Progress

The migration has already begun with the following components in place:

- Basic project structure following Kobweb conventions
- Theme system implementation (SiteTheme.kt)
- Basic Header component
- Documentation structure

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps in the migration process are:

1. Complete the layout components (Footer, Layout wrapper)
2. Create data models for portfolio content
3. Implement the HomePage and other key pages
4. Set up the backend API endpoints

## Team Structure

The migration will be implemented by five teams with specific responsibilities:

1. **Team 1: Infrastructure and Layout** - Weeks 1-3
   - Project setup, layout components, theme implementation

2. **Team 2: Pages and Components** - Weeks 3-8
   - Page implementation, UI components, state management

3. **Team 3: Backend and Data** - Weeks 4-9
   - API endpoints, data models, server configuration

4. **Team 4: Content and Styling** - Weeks 6-11
   - Content migration, styling, responsive design

5. **Team 5: Testing and Deployment** - Weeks 10-14
   - Testing, performance optimization, deployment

## How to Use These Documents

### For Team Leads

1. Start with the **updated-migration-plan.md** to understand the overall migration strategy
2. Review the **implementation-checklists.md** for your team's specific tasks and timeline
3. Use the **component-architecture.md** and **styling-guidelines.md** as reference for implementation standards
4. Set up regular sync meetings with other team leads to coordinate dependencies

### For Team Members

1. Review your team's section in the **implementation-checklists.md** for specific tasks
2. Reference the **component-architecture.md** for component implementation patterns
3. Follow the **styling-guidelines.md** for consistent styling approach
4. Track your progress using the checklists and report status in weekly meetings

## Key Migration Patterns

### Project Structure Mapping

| Original (shevapro-webapp) | New (shevapro-website) |
|----------------------------|------------------------|
| src/clientMain/kotlin/components | site/src/jsMain/kotlin/com/shevapro/website/components |
| src/clientMain/kotlin/components/commons | site/src/jsMain/kotlin/com/shevapro/website/components/ui |
| src/clientMain/kotlin/components/pages | site/src/jsMain/kotlin/com/shevapro/website/pages |
| src/clientMain/resources | site/src/jsMain/resources/public |

### React to Compose Migration

```
// React Component
val Component = FC<Props> { props -> ... }

// Kobweb Component
@Composable
fun Component(param1: Type, param2: Type) { ... }
```

### State Management

```
// React State
val (state, setState) = useState(initialValue)

// Compose State
var state by remember { mutableStateOf(initialValue) }
```

## Timeline Overview

The migration is planned to take approximately 14 weeks, with overlapping team responsibilities:

- **Weeks 1-3**: Project setup and layout components
- **Weeks 3-8**: UI components and page implementation
- **Weeks 4-9**: Backend and data integration
- **Weeks 6-11**: Content migration and styling
- **Weeks 10-14**: Testing and deployment

## Communication Plan

- Weekly sync meetings for all team leads
- Bi-weekly demos of completed work
- Shared documentation repository for cross-team reference
- Regular status updates in the project management tool

## Conclusion

This migration represents a significant upgrade from the existing Kotlin/JS React implementation to the modern Kobweb framework. By following the structured approach outlined in these documents, the migration can be completed efficiently while maintaining all functionality from the original site.

The migration leverages Kobweb's modern architecture and Compose for Web's declarative UI paradigm to create a more maintainable, performant, and feature-rich portfolio website.
