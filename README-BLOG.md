# Blog System - Shevapro Website

A comprehensive blog system for the Shevapro website that uses Kobweb's markdown support to create, manage, and display blog articles. The system automatically generates pages from markdown files, supports rich formatting, and includes features like tag filtering.

This document explains the blog system implementation in detail.

## ‚úÖ Blog System Status

### Current Implementation

1. **Blog Page** (`/blog`)
    - ‚úÖ Hero section with title and description
    - ‚úÖ Tag filtering system
    - ‚úÖ Article cards with previews
    - ‚úÖ Sample articles for demonstration

2. **Markdown Blog Articles**
    - ‚úÖ Located in `site/src/jsMain/resources/markdown/blog/`
    - ‚úÖ Auto-generated pages by Kobweb at build time
    - ‚úÖ Beautiful rendering with `MarkdownLayout`

3. **Sample Articles Created**
    - ‚úÖ **Welcome to My Blog** (`/blog/welcome-to-my-blog`)
    - ‚úÖ **Kotlin Multiplatform Guide** (`/blog/kotlin-multiplatform-guide`)
    - ‚úÖ **Compose HTML Tips** (`/blog/compose-html-tips`)

## üìÅ File Structure

```
site/src/jsMain/resources/markdown/blog/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ welcome-to-my-blog.md           # Personal introduction blog post
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kotlin-multiplatform-guide.md   # Technical tutorial on KMP
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ compose-html-tips.md            # Web development best practices
```

## üîß How It Works

### 1. Markdown Blog Posts

Each blog post uses YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Article Title
date: March 10, 2024
description: Article description for preview
author: Shevapro
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
posted: true
layout: .components.layouts.MarkdownLayout
routeOverride: blog/article-slug
---

# Article Content Here
```

### 2. Build-Time Generation

Kobweb automatically:

- Parses markdown files during build
- Generates page components with `@Page` and `@Layout` annotations
- Creates routes like `/blog/article-slug`
- Applies the `MarkdownLayout` for consistent styling

### 3. Blog Page Integration

The Blog page currently shows sample articles but will be updated to:

- Load real markdown articles when Kobweb's API becomes available
- Filter articles by tags
- Display article previews with links to full posts

## üé® Content Types

### Technical Articles

- Programming tutorials and guides
- Framework-specific tips and tricks
- Best practices and architecture

### Personal Posts

- Development journey experiences
- Industry insights and thoughts
- Project breakdowns and lessons learned

## üöÄ Navigation Flow

```
/blog ‚Üí Blog listing page with article previews
    ‚Üì (Click article title/read more)
/blog/article-slug ‚Üí Full markdown article with rich formatting
```

## üìù Article Features

### Rich Markdown Support

- Headers, paragraphs, lists
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Links and images
- Blockquotes and callouts
- Tables and formatting

### Responsive Design

## üéØ Adding New Blog Posts

### 1. Create Markdown File

Create a new file in `site/src/jsMain/resources/markdown/blog/`:

```markdown
---
title: Your Blog Post Title
date: January 1, 2024
description: Brief description for preview
author: Shevapro
tags: [relevant, tags, here]
posted: true
layout: .components.layouts.MarkdownLayout
routeOverride: blog/your-post-slug
---

# Your Content Here

Write your blog post content using standard markdown...
```

### 2. Build and Deploy

```bash
cd site
kobweb run  # For development
kobweb export --layout static  # For production
```

### 3. Update Blog Page (Future)

When Kobweb's markdown API is available, the blog page will automatically:

- Discover new articles
- Include them in the listing
- Update tag filters
- Sort by publication date

## üí° Best Practices

- Include code examples where appropriate

### Images and Media

- Store images in `site/src/jsMain/resources/public/assets/images/blog/`
- Use descriptive alt text
- Optimize file sizes for web
- Use responsive image techniques

### SEO and Accessibility

- Write semantic HTML in markdown
- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H3)
- Include meta descriptions
- Use descriptive link text

## üîÑ Migration from React

### Differences from Original

## ‚ö° Performance
